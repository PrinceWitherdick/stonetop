/**
 * The release bundle: every ES module the system loads, rolled into `dist/stonetop.js`.
 *
 * Why a release runs from one file. Foundry serves each file with `Cache-Control: no-cache`, so a
 * player's browser asks the server about every one of our ~530 modules on every load, and over
 * HTTP/1.1 it can ask only six at a time. Foundry's own low-priority scripts queue behind them, and
 * the whole boot waits on those. One file is one request.
 *
 * A checkout still runs the unbundled source: `system.json` names `stonetop.js`, and only
 * release.yml points the SHIPPED manifest at the bundle. Day-to-day development needs no build.
 *
 * Three settings here are load-bearing, and tests/build/bundle.test.js holds each one:
 *
 *   keepNames   Foundry builds AppV1 hook names (`renderStonetopLocationPageSheet`) and stored
 *               sheet ids (`flags.core.sheetClass`) out of class names, and bundling renames any
 *               top-level name two modules happen to share. keepNames restores the original `.name`.
 *   splitting   Off. Splitting still left 62 chunks to fetch before the system could start. Without
 *               it, a module reached only through `import()` is still evaluated lazily, on first use.
 *   warnings    Treated as errors, so anything esbuild is unsure about stops a release rather than
 *               shipping in it.
