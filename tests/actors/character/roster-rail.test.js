/**
 * The left rail that the standing rosters — the Judge's brands and oaths, the Blessed's five kinds
 * of mark — show their lists behind, one at a time.
 *
 * The lists grow without bound and never shrink on their own, so stacked they made a window taller
 * than the screen by the fourth session. The rail is what fixed that, and it fails in three ways
 * that a browser reports as nothing at all:
 *
 *  • the SETTLING. `_railFor` decides which panel shows, and it has to re-decide every render,
 *    because a list can stop existing under the player's hands (the last oath released, the last
 *    Barkskin lifted). Left pointing at a key nothing renders, the window comes back with every
 *    panel hidden and nothing lit in the rail: a blank window that looks broken.
 *  • the CLASS CONTRACT. The rail, the panels and the scroll column are found by three class names
 *    agreed between `RosterDialog._selectTab` and two templates. A rename binds nothing and throws
 *    nothing — the tabs simply stop switching.
 *  • the [hidden] TRAP. The panels declare `display: flex`, which out-specifies the UA's
 *    `[hidden] { display: none }`. Without a rule saying so, every panel renders at once and the
 *    rail is decoration on top of exactly the tall window it replaced.
