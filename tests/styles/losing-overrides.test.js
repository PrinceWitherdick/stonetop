/**
 * Overrides that are outranked by the rule they were written to beat.
 *
 * The failure mode is always the same and always silent: the stylesheet READS as though the
 * override were in force, nothing is logged, the element renders — it just renders in the other
 * rule's colour. `tests/styles/dialog-button-specificity.test.js` makes the same argument for one
 * family (a per-dialog footer button rule under the shared `.stonetop.dialog` one) and does it with
 * a scan. This file is the cases that are not about dialog footers, each pinned by name, because
 * each was shipped broken and none is derivable from a pattern:
 *
 *   - A bare `.x-remove:hover` under a `.x-btns button:hover` that carries an element and therefore
 *     outranks it. The red never lands and the trash icon greys like its neighbours.
 *   - An author `display` on a panel that JS hides with the `hidden` ATTRIBUTE. Author beats UA
 *     whatever the specificity, so `[hidden]` does nothing until the sheet says so itself.
 *   - A chat card notice's heading, painted in the generic `.cell__subtitle` grey the card sets
 *     ~800 lines further down at the same weight. The accent still reached the notice's left-hand
 *     rule, so the block rendered with a coloured edge and a grey title and read as intentional.
 *   - A TIE, settled by source order. An element wearing two of our classes gets the rule that sits
 *     LATER in the sheet for anything both declare, so a component's own rule written above the
 *     shared chrome it means to override is dead. Both surfaces below shipped that way for a
 *     release, and in each the rule's own comment says what it was supposed to do.
