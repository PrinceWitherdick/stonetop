/**
 * Splitting a follower card — particularly the Marshal's crew — so it stops eating the tab.
 *
 * Measured before this change, with a six-member crew on a 960px tab: the card stood 784px tall
 * with every section shut, and 1,535px with them open. The Followers grid holds two columns at
 * EVERY width (see `.stonetop-followers`), and the crew is the second card, so that height set
 * the height of the whole first row and left the Animal Companion beside it floating in dead
 * space. Only three things folded, and none of them was the part that was always on screen.
 *
 * The split is by WHEN A FIELD IS TOUCHED, not by what kind of field it is:
 *
 *   the vitals band  Armor, Damage, ammo, Loyalty, Readiness — what a fight reaches for. These
 *                    were five full-width rows; reading the card they flow as one wrapping band.
 *   the Details fold instinct, cost, moves, gear, notes — set once and read rarely. Folded shut.
 *   the card fold    the whole card down to its header strip plus the band, for a follower who
 *                    is not in this scene at all.
 *
 * Two rules make the folding worth doing rather than merely possible, and both are guarded here
 * because both are the kind of thing a later edit quietly undoes:
 *
 * A CLOSED SECTION MUST REPORT ITS OWN STATE. `5 ✓ · normal load`, `6 members · 23/36 HP · 1
 * down`. A fold that says nothing is a fold players leave open to read a number off, which is
 * how the card got tall in the first place — so the summary carries the number instead.
 *
 * AND THE PENCIL MUST NEVER OPEN ONTO A HIDDEN FIELD. Editing forces every fold open and drops
 * the band back to a stacked column, because under the pencil each of those rows grows an input.
 * That override is render-only: it must not reach the persisted set, or opening the pencil once
 * would wipe what the player chose to keep shut.
 *
 * After: 447px shut, 240px folded to the header, and at most one section open at a time unless
 * the player pins more.
