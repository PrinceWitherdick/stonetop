/**
 * The two buttons on a crew card's Inventory fold, and the list one of them fills.
 *
 * The Supplies button used to be captioned "Outfit crew" and cited p.472 for it. Outfit is a
 * real move and it is not what the button does: "when you prepare for an expedition in a
 * friendly community, mark as many ◇ on your Inventory insert as you wish to carry" (p.306) —
 * a follower's WHOLE load, gear and undefined marks both, which p.307 is explicit applies to
 * followers ("Followers need to Outfit, too!"). The crew's load is the diamond list ABOVE this
 * section, and the button has only ever refilled the row of Supplies below it. So it is named
 * for what it does, and Outfit stays available to mean the move.
 *
 * The list is the other half of that same p.472 sidebar, the half that used to be missing:
 * "the PC can direct one crew member to Have What They Need and add an item to their
 * inventory, without the rest of the crew each producing the same item." That item belongs to
 * one member, so it cannot go in the shared pip map — it goes in its own list, wired to the
 * free-text gear checklist every other follower card already carries (crew.details.gear), so
 * the shared toggle / rename / remove handlers reach it with no second implementation.
