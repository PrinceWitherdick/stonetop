/**
 * A follower's Loyalty and Readiness rows, and the Spend button at the end of each.
 *
 * The row holds three things that cannot give: a label slot fixed wide enough for "Readiness",
 * a pip track reserved in px so both rows' buttons start at the same x, and a button sized to
 * its own words. That is the whole point of the design on a roomy card — but the Followers grid
 * holds two columns at EVERY width now (see `.stonetop-followers`), so a sheet dragged to its
 * 800px floor hands the card less width than those three add up to. As grid tracks they had
 * nowhere to go: they overflowed, and the card's `overflow: hidden` sliced the Spend button in
 * half, which is what a player saw.
 *
 * So the row wraps. The two things this guards are the two ways the fix can be undone by someone
 * reading only the rule:
 *
 * IT MUST NOT GO BACK TO FIXED TRACKS. `display: grid` with three unshrinkable columns is the
 * bug. Flex is load-bearing here, not a style preference: it is what puts Spend on a second line
 * at exactly the width where it stops fitting.
 *
 * AND IT MUST NOT BE A PX BREAKPOINT. The tempting fix is a container query beside the header's,
 * and it is wrong: the label slot and the button are ems while the pips are px, so the width at
 * which Spend stops fitting MOVES with the client's UI Font Size setting. Measured on a 4-pip
 * card, it crossed the gutter at 274px of card at a 14px root but at 294px at 20px -- the size
 * this project's own player runs. Any single number leaves one font size clipping in the gap.
 *
 * The alignment the original grid existed for is asserted too, because it is the thing a rewrite
 * is most likely to drop on the way past: both rows share one label width and one pip
 * reservation, and the two buttons carry one icon box, so Loyalty and Readiness never disagree
 * about where their Spend sits or which shape they are in.
