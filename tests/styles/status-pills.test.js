/**
 * The sheets' three status pills are one pill in two colours.
 *
 * A person can wear more than one at a time, and when they do the pills sit side by side on the
 * same line: the NPC name row carries the lifecycle badge ("AWAY", "DEAD", "RETIRED") beside the
 * Judge's CONDEMNED brand, and the character sheet's appearance line carries the DEAD pill beside
 * that same brand. They were written months apart and had drifted apart with it (18.88, 23.27 and
 * 16.48px tall at one font size). Two marks of one colour at two heights read as a fault in the
 * sheet rather than as two features, and a word sitting off-centre in its pill reads as a mis-set
 * chip. The brand owns the numbers now and the other two borrow them, which is a pairing no single
 * rule can enforce -- hence this file. Three things hold it together:
 *
 *  - the SIZE, the LINE-HEIGHT and the PINNED HEIGHT must agree across the three, with no
 *    vertical padding;
 *  - every label is centred by TRIMMING its line box to its capitals (`text-box: trim-both cap
 *    alphabetic`) and letting `align-items: center` centre that, plus a small per-face residual,
 *    --st-caps-trim-nudge. What this replaced was a per-face `em` nudge on an untrimmed 1em box,
 *    and it could not hold: Blink rounds a font's ascent and descent to whole pixels, so where the
 *    caps sit in that box moves by up to a pixel from one font size to the next. Measured from
 *    rendered pixels, Signika's caps were up to 1px LOW at the large UI font sizes a real table
 *    runs, in both pills, which is what got reported;
 *  - so every label must be an ELEMENT. A bare text node in a flex row is an anonymous flex item,
 *    which does not take `text-box` (measured 1.4px off) and cannot be moved. All three pills wrap
 *    the word, in every template that renders one.
