/**
 * A follower card in EDIT MODE, and the three ways it stopped looking like the card beside it.
 *
 * Read a follower and the values sit on quiet fill lines. Open the pencil and, before this,
 * every one of them became a grey well with a soft dark halo, the "exceptional" tag inflated
 * into a full-width bar above the chips it belongs with, and "Add gear" grew to the size of the
 * card's Order button. None of that was declared anywhere: all three are Foundry core reaching
 * past rules that had asked for something quieter.
 *
 * 1. THE RING. Core paints `box-shadow: var(--input-box-shadow)` on every field, and under
 *    `theme-light` — the state every AppV1 window in this system renders in — that token is
 *    `inset 0 0 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`. On a bordered well it doubles the edge; on a field
 *    declared `border: none; background: transparent` it invents a box that was never asked for.
 *
 * 2. `:not(:focus)` ON THAT RESET, which is the half that is easy to drop and impossible to see.
 *    stonetop.css is unlayered and core's form rules are layered, so a bare `box-shadow: none`
 *    beats core in EVERY state, `:focus` included. That matters because core also has
 *    `body.game .app input:focus { outline: none }`: on an AppV1 window the glow IS the focus
 *    indicator, the outline having already been taken away. Killed flat, these fields took focus
 *    with no visible change at all — measured, not guessed.
 *
 * 3. `width: auto` ON THE TWO CONTROLS THAT ARE <button>s. Core's
 *    `body.game .app button { width: 100% }` catches them and nothing else in their rows: the
 *    exceptional chip's neighbours are <span>s and <label>s, and "Add gear" already asked for
 *    `justify-self: start`, which a `width: 100%` box ignores because it fills its grid area
 *    wherever it is placed. See [[reference_app-button-core-width-100]].
 *
 * Plus the one that is not CSS at all: the card body is a Handlebars partial, and Handlebars
 * re-indents a STANDALONE partial call's whole rendered output — the output STRING, so the
 * indent lands inside interpolated values too. Everywhere in this card that is invisible except
 * inside a <textarea>, where whitespace is content: Moves and Notes came back with two tabs in
 * front of every line after the first, and since the change handler stores `el.value` (trimmed
 * only at the ends) one edit wrote them into the actor and the next render added two more.
