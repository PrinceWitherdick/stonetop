/**
 * A long inventory name wraps BESIDE its load markers instead of dropping below them, on every row
 * that wraps: a Book II treasure, and an artifact write-in carrying a hint, lead or write-up.
 *
 * Those rows are wrapping flex rows (their extra lines stack beneath the name), and a wrapping flex
 * row breaks its lines on each item's one-line width before anything shrinks. The name was sized to
 * its own text (`flex: 0 1 auto`), so a name a word too long to fit beside the ◇s moved whole onto
 * the next line: "A shield of makerglass, etched with Aratis's symbol" under two stranded marks.
 *
 * The tag note takes a line of its own on both kinds. Left beside a write-in's name it competed for
 * the markers' line: a long note squeezed the name to a narrow column four lines deep, or pushed the
 * icons onto a line by themselves.
 *
 * Measured offline against Foundry 14's stylesheet and the shipped partials, at 16px and 20px roots,
 * font scale 1 and 1.25, across four column widths: with these rules the name shares the markers'
 * line at every width, the markers and icons sit on its first line, and a one-line row stays put.
