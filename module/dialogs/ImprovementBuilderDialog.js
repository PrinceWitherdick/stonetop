/**
 * The authoring sheet for a steading improvement, in the shape the book's own
 * improvements have: a name and flavor, any number of requirement GROUPS (each with its
 * own heading, its own "all of these" or "N of these" rule, and the option to be an
 * ALTERNATIVE to the group above it), the effect prose, and the mechanical effects that
 * are applied automatically on completion.
 *
 * It replaces the two hand-rolled forms that came before, which between them could
 * author one flat all-of-these requirement list and no automatic effects at all: not
 * enough to reproduce Weapons of War (either/or), Aurochs Hunting (2 of 3), or any
 * improvement whose completion is supposed to move a stat. Both entry points now open
 * THIS window and differ only in where the finished definition is written:
 *
 *   improvementCardSaver()          a reusable, draggable card in the homebrew journal
 *                                   (sidebar "Create Stonetop Content" flow);
 *   steadingImprovementSaver(...)   straight onto the open steading's Improvements tab.
 *
 * Four things make it possible to actually reproduce one of the book's improvements
 * rather than merely to store the same fields:
 *
 *   - a requirement is a ROW, not a line of a textarea, so it can be moved, dropped, and
 *     repeated: "Pull Together" times five becomes five boxes numbered (1st) to (5th),
 *     which is how Additional Housing, Raincatching, Stone Wall and Township are built;
 *   - *asterisks* mark the italics the playbook puts on every move name;
 *   - "Start from" fills the whole form from an improvement that already exists, either
 *     one of the seventeen built-ins or one already added to this steading; and
 *   - a Preview panel draws the card the Improvements tab will draw.
 *
 * Laid out as a left-rail stepped sheet, the same shared .stonetop-guide-* chrome as the
 * custom-move dialog and Make a Monster.
