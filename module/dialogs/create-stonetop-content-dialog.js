// reusable world Move, a draggable steading-improvement card, a draggable threat card,
// a reusable world inventory item or treasure, or a homebrew arcanum. Opened from StonetopItem.createDialog.
//
// TWO STEPS AT MOST. The first window offers a handful of broad kinds; a kind that covers
// several flows (Gear & Treasure, Dangers & Places) opens a second window to refine it, and
// the flows it holds are rows there, never a third window. A kind left with ONE flow the
// user may run is not a group at all: that flow's own row stands in the first window.

// if/else ladder beside it: a kind added to one and missed in the other is a picker option that
// silently creates nothing, or a flow nothing can reach, and neither fails loudly.
//
// Who may see a row is on the row too: `gmOnly` for GM prep, `arcanum` for the rows that obey
// arcanaCreationGmOnly. `{heading}` entries caption the rows after them in a refine window.
