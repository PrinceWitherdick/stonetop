// ── Character Introductions: answer/ask step flow (pure core) ───────────────────
// The looping "go around again" answer step (step4) and ask step (step6) cycle the
// table until every PC has either passed or answered all of their playbook's
// questions. This module holds that round-robin/done logic as pure functions so it
// can be unit-tested without a running Foundry — IntroductionsDialog.js and the GM's
// step-advance detection both call in. A PC's per-step record is
// { answers: [{q,a}], passed } (see the introductionsAnswers / flags.stonetop_pwd.intro
// shapes); `total` is that playbook's question count for the step (4).

// Is a PC finished with a step? Done when they passed, when they've answered every
// question, or when the step has no questions to offer them (defensive — every
// playbook has four, but a PC with none can neither answer nor be exhausted, so treat
// them as done rather than letting them trap the loop forever).
export function stepPcDone(step, total) {
	if (!Number.isFinite(total) || total <= 0) return true;
	const answers = Array.isArray(step?.answers) ? step.answers : [];
	return !!step?.passed || answers.length >= total;
}

// The next still-active PC index at or after `fromIndex` (exclusive), cycling with
// wrap-around, or -1 when everyone is done. `isDone(idx)` reports whether the PC at
// idx has finished the step. When only the current PC is still active it returns that
// same index (the turn stays on them until they answer or pass).
export function nextActiveIndex(fromIndex, count, isDone) {
	if (count <= 0) return -1;
	for (let s = 1; s <= count; s++) {

// when everyone is already done.

// ── Follower reaction to a cursor write ────────────────────────────────────────
// The GM authors the world cursor; every other client reacts to it. Deciding WHAT to
// do — open, repaint, raise, announce — is pure, so it lives here with the rest of the
// flow logic and IntroductionsDialog.handleIntroCursor is left as a thin adapter.

// The part of a cursor that decides whether a repaint is worth interrupting someone
// mid-sentence for. THREE fields, and the omissions are the point:
//   • `nonce`/`showNonce` exist only to make an otherwise-identical write fire onChange
//     at all, so they never mean the screen changed.
//   • `pcOrder` is the ROSTER, not the turn. It churns on its own during session zero —
//     _syncCursorFromLocal's no-op guard counts it, so every late PC joining the tracker
//     rewrites the cursor — and none of that reaches the capture field the active player
//     is writing in. Excluding it is what stops a roster reshuffle eating their sentence;
//     their turn strip just refreshes on the next repaint instead.
// `activeUserId` IS included: it decides who may edit, so a change there has to reach the
// screen even mid-word (the field may need to go read-only).

	return [cursor.phase, cursor.activeActorId, cursor.activeUserId].join("|");

/**
 * What a follower client should do about a cursor write.
 *
 * One turn attracts SEVERAL cursor writes — a roster reshuffle as another player commits
 * a playbook, the active PC's owner going idle and back, the GM's "Show players" — and
 * every one of them used to repaint and re-raise the dialog on the active player's screen.
 * A repaint rebuilds the capture textarea from the last SAVED value, so a player typing
 * mid-word watched their sentence snap back to where the autosave had got to. Hence the
 * two gates below: repaint only when the screen is genuinely out of date, and raise only
 * on a real hand-off.
 *
 * @param {object}       args.cursor         The cursor just written.
 * @param {string|null}  args.prevKey        The position key this client last applied.
 * @param {string}       args.userId         This client's user id.
 * @param {boolean}      args.isRoundRobin   Is cursor.phase one the active PC authors?
 * @param {boolean}      args.hasDialog      Is the dialog open on this client?
 * @param {boolean}      args.typing         Is the caret inside that open dialog?
 * @param {number|null}  args.lastShowNonce  Highest "Show players" nonce already honoured.
 * @param {string|null}  args.lastTurnKey    Turn this client last announced.
 * @returns {{close: boolean, open: boolean, render: boolean, raise: boolean, toast: boolean,
 *           positionKey: string, turnKey: string|null, showNonce: number|null}}
 *          `positionKey`/`turnKey`/`showNonce` are the caller's new bookkeeping values.
