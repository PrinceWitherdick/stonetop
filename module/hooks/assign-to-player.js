/**
 * "Assign to Player…" on an actor's right-click menu in the Actors sidebar, GM only.
 *
 * User Configuration's Character dropdown offers playbook characters alone
 * (user-config-characters.js), which is right for the everyday case. This is the way round
 * it on purpose: a GM handing a player an NPC to run (a hireling taking over after a death,
 * say) picks the actor first, then the player.
 *
 * Setting `User#character` grants nothing by itself, so the pick also makes the player an
 * owner of the actor; without that they could not open the sheet or move the token. Anyone
 * who held the actor before is released, since one actor is one player's character: no longer
 * their character, and no longer an owner of it either, or they could still run it.
