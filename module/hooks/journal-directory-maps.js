/**
 * KEEP THE RELATIONSHIP MAPS OUT OF THE JOURNAL SIDEBAR.
 *
 * A map is a JournalEntry and has to be one: writing a world setting needs SETTINGS_MODIFY, which
 * is an assistant-GM right, so a map kept in a setting is a map no player can draw on -- while a
 * document the whole table OWNS is one anybody may edit, with the server broadcasting each change
 * for free. The long version of that argument is at the top of relmap/relmap-doc.js.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT FOLLOW is that the storage has to be furniture in the Journal tab. A world arrives
 * with a "Relationship Maps" folder holding a "Stonetop" nobody asked for, in the same list as the
 * gazetteer and the Chronicle and everything else a table actually browses, and every map made
 * afterwards lands there too. The map is not read as a journal entry by anyone: it is opened from
 * the steading sheet's own tab, from the hotbar macro, and from the one button this file puts at the
 * top of the Journal tab, all of which go straight to the board.
 *
 * SO THE ROWS ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE RENDER, and nothing about the document changes. Ownership,
 * editing, broadcast, `@UUID` links, the sheet class, the folder itself -- all exactly as they
 * were; what is gone is two lines in a list. That is also why this is a render hook and not, say,
 * an ownership change: hiding by permission would take the map away from the players who are meant
 * to be drawing on it.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS A SCREEN, NOT A VAULT, which is the same sentence relmap-doc.js says about hidden
 * boards. Foundry ships every world JournalEntry to every client; this hides what is DRAWN. Nothing
 * here is a secret being kept -- the map is meant to be opened, just not from this list.
 *
 * ⚠ A WHOLE MAP CANNOT BE RENAMED OR DELETED ANYWHERE ONCE ITS ROW IS GONE, and that is on purpose.
 * This list was the last place that offered either; the map window's title-bar buttons that took
 * over were removed at the user's request, because a Stonetop world has one map and the table works
 * in its pages (which the page strip's own pen and trash still rename and delete).
