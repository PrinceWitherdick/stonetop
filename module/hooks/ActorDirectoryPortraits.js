/**
 * Show a chosen portrait frame on the Actors sidebar rows.
 *
 * The frame is a rect on a flag, painted by an inline style, so only surfaces that know about it
 * apply it — and core's directory template renders a bare `<img src="{{img}}">`. The result was a
 * person whose face was cropped on every sheet in the system and uncropped in the one list a GM
 * scrolls all day.
 *
 * Nothing is written and no file is baked: the row's own image is wrapped in a clipping box and
 * given the same style the sheets use, so this works for a player with no upload rights and
 * reverts the moment a frame is cleared.
 *
 * TWO ENTRY POINTS, because the directory is only redrawn for changes core cares about — a
 * document created or deleted, or its name / img / sort / folder changed. A frame lives in
 * `flags`, which core does not watch, so framing somebody left the sidebar showing the old crop
 * until the next reload. `onUpdateActorPortraitFrame` closes that: it repaints the one row that
 * changed rather than re-rendering the directory, so nobody's scroll position or open folders
 * move because a face was cropped.
 *
 * The render hook is bound to `renderDocumentDirectory` rather than `renderActorDirectory`:
 * ApplicationV2 fires a render hook for every class in the inheritance chain and the parent's
 * name is the stable one (the same reason CompendiumItemIcons.js binds there). The collection
 * check below is therefore load-bearing — every other sidebar tab reaches this handler too.
 *
 * A compendium's Actor rows are deliberately NOT decorated: they render off the pack index, which
 * carries `img` but not `flags`, so there is no frame to read there without fetching every
 * document in the pack on every render.
