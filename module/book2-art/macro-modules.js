// The system modules the "Import Book Art" macro borrows, handed to it on
// `game.stonetop.macroModules` rather than imported by their served path.
//
// The macro is a Script macro, outside our module graph, so it used to `import()` these files by
// path. Unbundled, that returned the very module instances the system had already loaded. A release
// runs from one bundled file (scripts/bundle.js), where those paths are no longer part of the running
// system: importing them there loads SECOND copies of everything they pull in, each with its own
// caches (browse.js's folder listings, settings.js's values) that the system's hooks never clear.
//
// These loaders are resolved by whichever build is running, so the macro always gets the system's
// own instances. They stay lazy: nothing here is loaded until the macro asks. The macro keeps its
// path import as the fallback. tests/book2-art/macro-modules.test.js holds the keys, the modules they
// load, and the macro's use of them together.
