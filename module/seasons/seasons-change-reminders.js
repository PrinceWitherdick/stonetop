// ── Seasons Change reminders ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A few playbook moves and special possessions have rules that fire "each
// season" / "once per season" (Book I). When the GM runs the Seasons Change move
// on the steading, a single public chat card lists every player character that
// carries one of these alongside its season-facing rule — so the seasonal upkeep
// doesn't get forgotten. The card is an ordinary ChatMessage, so it syncs to the
// whole table on its own (no socket needed).

// The seasonal upkeep registry. `kind` decides how a character is matched:
//   • "move"       — an embedded move Item with this exact name.
//   • "possession" — a selected special-possession slug (flags.stonetop_pwd.possessions.selected).
// `rule` is the season-facing reminder text shown in the card.
// `seasons` (optional) limits an entry to the seasons listed; omitted means every season.
//
// EVERYTHING HERE IS QUOTED FROM THE BOOK, and the card goes out publicly to the whole
// table, so an entry that paraphrases loosely teaches the table a rule that does not exist.
// Before adding one, find the printed line. Holy relics (The Lightbearer) was listed here
// with a "Restore 1 use this season" refresh and a "+1 to a roll involving Helior's favor"
// effect; it has NEITHER. Book I p.430, Book II's Helior entry, and the Lightbearer playbook
// all read the same and say nothing about seasons: "Holy relics (___ uses): if you have one
// in inventory when you Invoke the Sun God, you can mark a use in lieu of choosing a
// consequence." (The +1 belongs to Piety's Blessing, a different thing entirely.) Its uses
// are a one-way pool, so it does not belong in a seasonal-upkeep card at all.
