// THE COLOUR EACH KIND OF TIMELINE ROW WEARS, AND THE ARITHMETIC THAT KEEPS A GM'S CHOICE READABLE.
//
// The stylesheet carries the shipped palette as `--st-timeline-kind-<kind>` tokens, one value per
// skin (light, Lamplit dark, and the two high-contrast skins). This file holds the SAME values, held
// to the stylesheet by tests/timeline/timeline-colours.test.js, for two jobs the stylesheet cannot
// do: seeding the GM's colour picker with what a kind wears today, and turning ONE colour the GM
// chose into four, one per skin, each readable on the paper that skin paints.
//
// ⚠ ONE COLOUR IN, FOUR OUT. A GM picks a purple on whatever skin they happen to read in. The
// player across the table may be on the dark page, and the one on the magnifier on high contrast;
// a purple deep enough for parchment is invisible on #1d1915. So the choice is kept as the HUE it
// names and walked along its own lightness until it clears that skin's floor, the same bargain
// relmap-ink.js#deepenInk strikes for a line on the relationship map (and the same function does
// the walking). A colour that already clears the floor is used exactly as chosen.
//
// ⚠ NO IMPORT FROM timeline-core.js, and the kind list is restated below rather than derived from
// TIMELINE_SOURCES. settings.js imports this file to repaint on change, and timeline-core reaches
// the season clock, which is one of the routes back into settings. A test holds the two lists
// together instead.
