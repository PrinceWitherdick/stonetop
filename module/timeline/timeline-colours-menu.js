// THE GM'S TIMELINE COLOURS: the colour each kind of row wears, for the whole world.
//
// A dropdown hung under the toolbar's Colours button, as the Filter menu hangs under its own (user,
// 2026-10-04). It was a window of its own; this is the same picker with the window taken away. The
// timeline holds one of these per host and draws the menu's rows from it, so a pick survives the
// repaint anyone's write at the table causes while the menu is open.
//
// One colour in, four out (timeline-colours.js): the GM picks on whatever skin they read in, and
// each skin gets that hue walked along its lightness until it reads there -- darker on the light
// pages, lighter on the dark ones. So the row previews the colour THIS page will wear, and says so
// when the pick had to be adjusted to read here.
//
// ⚠ THE NOTE IS FOR THIS SKIN ONLY. No one colour clears 7:1 on both the white high-contrast page
// and the near-black one, so "adjusted on some skin" is true of every pick there is and would sit
// on every row saying nothing.
//
// Only the kinds the GM actually picked are written; the rest keep the stylesheet's shipped colour,
// which is hand-tuned per skin. That is also why a pick that lands back ON this skin's shipped
// colour counts as no pick: kept as a choice, it would be walked into the other three skins and
// replace their own tuned colours with a derived one.
//
// NOTHING IS WRITTEN UNTIL SAVE. A press outside shuts the menu as it shuts Filter, but the picks
// wait in the draft for the menu to open again; only Cancel throws them away.
