// MILESTONES, ONTO THE TIMELINE.
//
// The one place the system writes a row for itself: a level gained, a foe slain, an expedition home,
// a site visited, a death, a lasting wound, an arcanum, a follower gained or lost. Each caller says
// WHAT happened; this says WHEN (the campaign clock, now) and does the writing.
//
// THE RULES EVERY MILESTONE FOLLOWS:
//
//  • STORED, NOT DERIVED. A milestone is an ordinary entry. The table can retitle it, re-date it,
//    add a note to it, or delete it, exactly like a row somebody typed -- it is their history, and
//    the system only wrote the first draft.
//  • WRITTEN ONCE, by `key`. The same event recorded twice (a correction, a reload mid-dialog, two
//    clients noticing the same change) patches the row it already wrote instead of adding a second.
//    See `upsertByKey` in timeline-core.js.
//  • A FOOTNOTE, NEVER A FAILURE. Nothing here throws. A world with no steading, a reader who may not
//    write the page, a page mid-delete: the milestone is skipped with one console warning, and the
//    thing that happened (the damage, the level, the death) goes ahead regardless.
