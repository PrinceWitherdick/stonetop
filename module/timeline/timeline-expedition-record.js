// AN EXPEDITION'S ROW, WRITTEN.
//
// The one writer for a trip on the timeline (the row itself is built, purely, in
// timeline-expedition.js). Two things reach for it: the Expedition walkthrough, when the GM steps
// into the homecoming by Next or presses its record button, and the Return Triumphant move, once
// the move has been made, from the walkthrough's last step or from the steading sheet's own move
// card. It used to live inside the walkthrough, and so a triumph made from the steading sheet never
// reached the trip's row at all.
//
// GM-ONLY. The trip's record is the world-scoped `expeditionAnswers` setting, and the row goes on
// several threads at once: everyone who went, and Stonetop's.
//
// WHICH COPY OF THE LOG. An open walkthrough keeps its own copy of the log for its lifetime and
// merges other writes into it (see ExpeditionDialog#onLogChanged), so while one is up its copy is
// the log: it is read through the window and written back through the window, or the window's
// next save would put its older copy back over this one. With no window up, the setting is read
// and written directly.
