// THE LEVELS A CHARACTER GAINED BEFORE THE TIMELINE WAS WATCHING.
//
// The timeline records a level-up as it happens. A table that has been playing for months before
// the timeline shipped would otherwise open it to find every character's thread empty of the one
// milestone they all have. Their change ledgers DO remember: "Level changed from 2 to 3", with the
// real-world moment it happened. The season log (timeline-seasons.js, collected since long before
// the timeline was switched on) turns that moment into the season it fell in.
//
// LEVEL-UPS ONLY. They are the one kind the ledger records cleanly, with a number to key on; every
// other milestone either has no ledger line at all (a death) or one that cannot be told apart from
// bookkeeping (a wound edited, an arcanum flag rewritten).
//
// ONCE PER WORLD, and safe to repeat anyway: each row carries the same `levelup:<n>` key a live
// level-up writes, so a level the timeline already has is never written twice, whichever got there
// first. The once-only marker is a flag on the Timeline journal itself, so a world whose journal is
// rebuilt simply backfills again into the fresh one.
