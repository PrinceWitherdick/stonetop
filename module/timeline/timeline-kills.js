// WHO STRUCK THE FINAL BLOW, AND HOW MANY FELL TO IT.
//
// Pure rules for the kill tally (the table's ask: a player who lands the blow that drops a foe gets
// it on their timeline, dated, and counted). The Apply-damage step in combat/attack-flow.js says
// only what HAPPENED: each applied row on the card carries how many bodies its blow felled
// (fight/group-hits.js#killsFromHit). Who that is credited to is the timeline's question, asked by
// timeline-watch.js when the card's applied rows change, which hands the names to
// timeline-record.js#recordKills in ONE write per Apply.
//
// WHAT COUNTS (the user's rulings, 2026-10-01):
//  • The character's OWN blow. Not a follower's (a crew's swing, an off-map follower blow, which
//    arrives carrying its character as the attacker but is flagged `followerBlow`), and never the
//    card a character TOOK (a `selfHarm` card names the character who was hit as its attacker).
//  • A FOE: a monster, or an NPC the fight puts on the other side. Never another character, never
//    a follower -- the fight's own answer to that question is reused rather than restated: the side
//    stamped on the target's combatant, else `classifySide`, because disposition alone reads every
//    character as hostile (timeline-watch.js#struckFoe).
//  • The blow that took it from standing to down. A foe already at 0 is not killed again.
//
// Only blows applied through the card count. A GM typing 0 into a monster's HP box, or core's skull
// toggle, carries no attacker, and guessing one would credit the wrong player.
