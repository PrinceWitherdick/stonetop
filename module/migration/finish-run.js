/**
 * Phase 3 entry point: the once-per-world sweep that runs on the first launch AFTER the
 * world has been re-pointed at the renamed system.
 *
 * Deliberately not part of the bridge's own migration. Rewriting asset paths and
 * compendiumSource stamps while the OLD system is still the running one immediately
 * breaks the features that recognise their own content by those strings. Once only one
 * system has to be consistent, the sweep is safe.
 *
 * Two things here that `finishDocuments` cannot reach on its own, because neither is an
 * asset path or a compendium reference:
 *   - `core.sheetClasses`, whose stale entries actively SUPPRESS `makeDefault` on the
 *     newly registered sheets, so actors open on Foundry's generic sheet with no error.
 *   - `core.compendiumConfiguration`, keyed by `<packageId>.<packName>`, which carries the
 *     GM's per-pack lock, folder and ownership choices.
 *
 * Both are read at init, so their fix only takes effect on the next reload. That is why
 * the run finishes by asking for one.
