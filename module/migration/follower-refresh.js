// Bring the follower cards made from the system's own lists up to those lists.
//
// A possession's follower (possession-followers.js) and an arcanum's summon (arcana-summons.js) are
// built into a card once, when they are added, and nothing revisits the card. Most of what has
// changed in those lists since is a player's call the card already records (how many Hounds), or is
// put right by asking (the beautiful scroll's tulpa, summon-repair.js). What is left is a handful of
// values that were simply wrong:
//   • the Would-be Hero's good dog was baked as a HERDER, with a note to change it by hand, before
//     the retriever-or-herder pick on the possession led its tags (2026-09-25);
//   • Thistlewik's "indistinguishable voice" is a "disembodied voice" (2026-08-23);
//   • the Servants of Daagon's move list was cut short (2026-08-23).
//
// THE SAME RULE AS THE HELD MOVES (move-refresh.js), with the old values listed here by hand: the
// lists are code, not pack data, so the history generator cannot read them. A card is corrected only
// while its field still holds exactly a value an older release wrote, so a player's own edit stays.
// The dog's tags change only when the player has picked: with no pick there is no right answer yet,
// and the old note asking for one stays with it. Per version, from Ready.
