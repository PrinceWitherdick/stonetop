/**
 * Take the blank entries back out of location and Chronicle pages' Dangers lists.
 *
 * From 2026-06-14 until 43ca5442 the page sheet read a Dangers list back off its edit form by
 * `[data-group-index]`, which the row AND the editor inside it both carry, so every entry was read
 * twice, the second time blank. Every save of a Dangers list therefore wrote a blank entry after
 * each real one, and so did closing a book page's pop-out, because the editors save themselves as
 * they are taken off the page. Reading never shows a blank entry, so nobody saw them; editing
 * shows each one as an empty row, and a list saved a few times had more blanks than entries.
 *
 * WHAT IS BLANK: no title, and a body with no words in it and nothing else a person put there (a
 * picture, a table, a divider). That is exactly what the bug wrote. A GM's own "Add danger" left
 * unfilled looks the same and goes too, which loses nothing: it is invisible when reading, and
 * the button makes another.
 *
 * SAFE FOR THE MANAGED BOOK UPDATES: no shipped Dangers list has a blank entry, so a page still
 * as shipped is never written, and stays pristine.
 *
 * Idempotent: a second pass finds nothing. Run once per version from Ready.js.
