// Expedition, so the writer now stores the trip's name alone (timeline-expedition.js). The rows
// written before that are rewritten here, ONCE PER WORLD, rather than stripped on every read: a
// read-time strip ran forever, and took the word off a title a GM had typed that way on purpose.
//
// Only a row the expedition writer made (`source: "expedition"`, keyed `expedition:<trip>`) is
// touched. The once-only marker is a flag on the Timeline journal, as timeline-backfill.js does.
