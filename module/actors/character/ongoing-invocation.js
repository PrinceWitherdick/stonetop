/**
 * WHICH Invocation the Lightbearer is holding open — the one they are concentrating on.
 *
 * The Invocations tab has always printed the rule ("While one Invocation is ongoing, you can't
 * use another. You can end an Invocation whenever you wish, and it will end immediately if your
 * holy light is extinguished") and nothing on the sheet ever recorded which one was running. Seven
 * of the ten Invocations are ongoing, so the two things that rule turns on — that reaching for a
 * second Invocation drops the first, and that a snuffed light drops it too — were exactly the two
 * nobody noticed, because the first one was never written down.
 *
 * A bare slug rather than an object, for holy-light.js's reason: setFlag deep-merges plain
 * objects, so a stored `{slug, label}` could only ever shed a key through the `-=` dance, while a
 * string is replaced wholesale. The printed name is not stored at all: it is looked up in the
 * playbook's own Invocation list, where it cannot go stale, and falls back to a prettified slug
 * for an Invocation stranded by a playbook swap.
 *
 * TWO SLOTS, each its own scalar flag (the same reason again). The first is the Invocation being
 * held; the second is filled only by the two moves that let a Lightbearer run two at once:
 *  - Burn Twice as Bright: "you may mark a debility to use 2 Invocations at once" (both at once,
 *    so both slots are written together).
 *  - an EMPOWERED Dancing Light: "you can use another Invocation through the Dancing Light while
 *    it is ongoing", so the next Invocation goes into the second slot and the Dancing Light keeps
 *    the first. That is why whether the first was empowered is stored beside it.
 * And one "snuff" stamp per slot: the Invoke consequence "the light is snuffed out when the
 * Invocation is complete" is paid when THAT Invocation ends, however it ends. The model honours it
 * (StonetopCharacter#setInvocationState); the stamp is written by whoever reads the consequence.
 *
 * Kept out of the sheet and the character model so the rules below can be tested without a
 * Foundry global in sight — the same split holy-light.js and condemn.js make.

 *    it into the second slot (replacing whatever was there). Re-invoking the Dancing Light
 *    empowered keeps the second too; re-invoking it plain lets the second go.

 * again: renewing the one you are already holding does not drop it and pick it back up, and a
