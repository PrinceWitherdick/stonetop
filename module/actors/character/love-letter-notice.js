// ── "A love letter has arrived" ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A red envelope that drops from the top edge of the screen, just right of the weather/season
// bar, when one of the player's characters has a love letter (Book I p.568) they haven't been
// told about yet, and rings a few bells as it comes. The envelope alone, no words (the user's
// call): what it's about is its hover and its accessible name. Without it a letter sits quietly at the top of the Moves tab and
// a player who isn't looking there never knows the GM wrote them anything.
//
// PLAYERS ONLY. The GM wrote the letter; telling them it arrived is noise.
//
// Tapping it puts it away and opens the letter: the character's sheet, on Moves, Love Letters in
// view. It stays away until a NEW letter arrives, and a GM's Resend counts as one (it restamps
// `loveLetterSentAt`, love-letters.js). An edit does not.
//
// What "told about" means is stored on the USER, as the list of letters the player tapped away,
// one token per letter and arrival (`<actorId>/<itemId>@<arrival key>`). On the user rather than
// in the browser so a reload, or a second device, doesn't ring the bells again for a letter the
// player has already been told about. A list rather than a keyed map because a setFlag MERGES
// objects and could never drop a letter that's gone, while it replaces a list whole. Tokens are
// only ever compared for equality, never ordered, so the GM's clock and the player's need not agree.
