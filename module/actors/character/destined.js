// The Would-Be Hero's Destined background (Book I p.137):
//
//   "At the start of a session, roll +Omens: on a 7+, lose all Omens and the GM will describe a vision or
//   portent that points toward your fate and/or clarifies your current situation; also, on a 10+, ask the GM a
//   follow-up question and get a clear, helpful answer; on a 6-, don't mark XP, hold +1 Omen, and tell us of
//   your recent nightmares or a troubling vision, and how your fears play into them.
//   Until your destiny is fulfilled, treat a 6- on Death's Door as a 7-9, and a 7-9 as a 10+."
//
// Both halves live on the background's setup tracks (`setup.resources`, background-tracks.js): the Omens a
// 3-circle track (the book prints three), and the destiny a 1-circle "Destiny fulfilled" box the player
// ticks when the story says so. A change of background empties both (StonetopCharacter#settleBackgroundResources),
// so a hero who comes back to Destined starts with no Omens and a destiny still ahead of them.
//
// The roll itself is a background move, Omens of Fate, given the way the Sheriff is given Bark an Order
// (`requirement.background`): its Omens held stand in for the stat (move-roll-options.js), and what its tier
// does to the track is settled like any other tier effect (tier-effects.js), so a Shift or a +1 moves it too.
