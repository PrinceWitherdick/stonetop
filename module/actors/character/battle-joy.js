/**
 * The Heavy's Battle Joy — the state half their playbook is written against, and the only state on
 * this sheet that changes what marks already printed on it MEAN:
 *
 *   "When you spill blood — yours or another's — and lose yourself in battle, you ignore fear,
 *    pain, mind-control, and the effects of debilities AS LONG AS YOU KEEP FIGHTING. When the
 *    action stops, roll +CON: on a 10+ … regain 1d4 HP; on a 7-9 … winded; on a 6-, mark a
 *    debility but don't mark XP."
 *
 * Three things follow from that, and they are why this is a header glyph rather than a note:
 *
 *  1. It is switched ON in the fiction and stays on across rolls, scenes and (in a long fight)
 *     sessions — nothing on the sheet recorded it, so the icon does.
 *  2. Berserker reads it by name ("WHILE IN YOUR BATTLE JOY, add the area tag to your melee
 *     attacks"), the same way Luminous Shield reads a holy light.
 *  3. Its debility clause is enforceable: debilities are the sheet's own three tick boxes, and
 *     every roll they touch goes through StonetopCharacter#applyDebilityRollMode. So a raging
 *     Heavy stops taking disadvantage from them, the three boxes go grey, and both facts undo
 *     themselves the moment the Joy ends. See `ignoresDebilities` below.
 *
 * ONE FLAG, never a counter: you are in it or you are not. Contrast condemn.js, whose brand has to
 * be a list; the shape here is the Lightbearer's candle (holy-light.js), which is worth reading
 * beside this — the "shown while the state stands on a sheet that lost the move" rule is the same,
 * and for the same reason.
 *
 * Kept out of the sheet and the character model so the predicates can be tested without a Foundry
 * global in sight.
