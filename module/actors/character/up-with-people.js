/**
 * The Would-Be Hero's UP WITH PEOPLE:
 *
 *   "When you converse with someone (PC or NPC) you can hold 2 Rapport with them. If you do, they hold
 *    1 Rapport with you. During the conversation, either of you can spend 1 Rapport to ask the other
 *    player one of the following and get an honest answer.
 *     - What weighs you down or holds you back?
 *     - What drives you forward?
 *     - What lesson would you have me learn?
 *     - What do you think of me, truly?"
 *
 * TWO HOLDS, STORED APART (the user's ruling). The hero's 2 Rapport are the move's own pips (a hold
 * track: a ticked pip is held, MoveResources#setUses). The partner's 1 is not a third pip on that
 * track, where spending one of the hero's could clear it:
 *  - a PC partner holds it on THEIR OWN character (flag `rapport`, keyed by the hero's actor id), shown
 *    as a chip in their sheet's header and spent there, as Piety's Blessing and We Happy Few's
 *    Inspiration are held (roll-boosts.js, inspiration.js). Written here for a PC this client owns, and
 *    by the GM's client for the rest (UP_WITH_PEOPLE_QUERY).
 *  - an NPC partner's is a "theirs" pip on the hero's own card (the `theirs` of the conversation
 *    record), for the GM to tick off when the NPC asks.
 *
 * THE CONVERSATION is recorded on the hero (flag `upWithPeople`): who with, and whether they are a PC.
 * A new one replaces it, both sides: the hero holds 2 again, and a PC partner of the last one lets go
 * of theirs. Every spend posts the four questions, named for who asks whom.
 *
 * KEPT UNTIL SPENT, as Blessing and Inspiration are: nothing clears a hold at the end of a session. It
 * goes when it is spent, or when the hero starts another conversation.
 *
 * Kept free of Foundry globals apart from ChatMessage and the actors collection, so it tests with plain
 * objects.
