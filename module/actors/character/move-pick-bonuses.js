/**
 * Moves (and backgrounds) that change how many options a roller may take off ANOTHER move's
 * printed list, or add to that list: the Fox's Perceptive ("When you Seek Insight, you may ask 1
 * additional question. Even on a 6-, you can ask 1 question"), the Ranger's Survivalist ("When
 * you Forage, pick 1 extra choice (even on a 6-, pick 1) and add ... to the list of options"), the
 * Fox's The Natural ("add 'What opportunity does no one else see?' to the list of possible
 * questions").
 *
 * The caps themselves are read off the move's own prose and stamped on its tickable list
 * (utils/chat.js#pickableMoveDescription), which is a reading of the MOVE and knows nothing of who
 * rolled it. So a Perceptive Fox's 4th question on a 10+ quietly let go of her 1st, and her 6-
 * showed no list at all. This is the per-roller half, laid over that stamp where the roll card is
 * built and the roller is known (item/StonetopItem.js#roll).
 *
 * The "you can always ask X for free, even on a 6-" moves (Hound of Aratis, Vision Unclouded, Sniff
 * Out Corruption, Attuned, Voice of Experience, Expert Tracker) are here too, as a row of their own
 * shape: `freeQuestion`. They grant ONE named question OUTSIDE the count, which a capped list cannot
 * say, so they never touch the list or its stamp. Each is a line of its own under the list
 * (`freeQuestionLines`), shown on every tier, the 6- included, where the list itself is hidden.
 * So are the Seeker's Deep Insight (one question "not limited to the list", about something magical)
 * and Well Versed (a follow-up of your choice on Know Things about one of your topics): their question
 * is the roller's own, so the line names what it may be rather than quoting it, and Well Versed's
 * lands at the end of a Know Things card, which prints no list.

/**
 * `move` is the move whose list changes. The row applies when the roller has `ownsLearned`
 * LEARNED, or took `background` (`{ playbook, slug, label }`).
 *
 * `plus` raises every tier that already reaches the list; `missFloor` opens the 6- with that many.
 * `addOptions` are appended to the list, in the granting text's own words (pinned against the pack
 * by tests/actors/character/move-pick-bonuses.test.js, so a reworded source fails a test rather
 * than drifting).
 *
 * `freeQuestion` is a question the roller may always ask on top of whatever the tier allows, on
 * every tier: it is not an option on the list and not one of its count. `when` is the granting
 * move's own narrower trigger, where it has one (Expert Tracker's is Seek Insight "by searching
 * for or studying the signs left by passing creatures"). The card cannot tell how the roller
 * studied, so the line says the condition and the table honours it.
 *
 * `capTo` LOWERS a tier's cap (`{partial: 1}`), for a move that takes a chooser away rather than
 * adding a choice. `rollOption` gates a row on something decided for THIS roll rather than owned,
 * read from the roll's pick context (StonetopCharacter#withPickContext): an Invocation empowered
 * before the dice. `detailKey` replaces the note's generated "N more on a hit" with the move's own
 * words, where the count alone would misdescribe it. Rows apply in table order, which matters for
 * Invoke the Sun God: Glorious Servant's 7-9 of 1 is set before Empowered's +1 lands on it.
