/**
 * The Judge's oaths — Binding Arbitration, the second Judge move that leaves something standing
 * after the scene ends:
 *
 *   "When you bear witness to someone's promise or oath, HENCEFORTH you may ask their player if
 *    they have kept their word. They must answer honestly. The character need not be present. If
 *    they have broken their word, you gain advantage on ALL rolls against them UNTIL they admit
 *    their wrongdoing and suffer an appropriate consequence (your call)."
 *
 * "Henceforth", "need not be present", "until they admit their wrongdoing": three clauses that each say
 * this outlives the table's memory of it. A Judge who witnessed an oath in session four and cannot
 * remember whose it was has lost the move, and nothing on any sheet wrote it down.
 *
 * SAME SHAPE AS THE BRAND, DELIBERATELY, and stored beside it rather than in its own window: both
 * are lists of people the Judge is holding something over, both end only when the Judge says so,
 * and a second header glyph for the second list would have said "the Judge has two kinds of
 * paperwork" rather than "here is what you are keeping". They share the scales. See condemn.js for
 * the brand and marked-people.js for the list algebra both use.
 *
 * ONE EXTRA FIELD over a brand: `broken`. It is not decoration — it is the whole mechanical half
 * of the move (advantage on all rolls against an oathbreaker), and it is a state the Judge learns
 * by ASKING, at a moment that has nothing to do with the roll it later affects. Ticking it is how
 * the answer survives to the roll.
 *
 * Kept Foundry-free so the predicates can be tested without a world in sight.
