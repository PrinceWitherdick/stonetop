 * How many Invocations a character should know at their level, for the Invocations tab's "N of M"

 * blue "still to choose", over shows the gold caution.
 *
 * The Lightbearer: "you start knowing 2 Invocations. Each time you reach an even-numbered level,
 * learn 1 new Invocation" (the insert, p.146), so 2 + floor(level / 2).
 *
 * Anyone else with Invoke the Sun God (a Would-be Hero through Versatile) starts knowing none and
 * learns one at each even level from the one they took the move at (Level Up step 5: "If you are the
 * Lightbearer (or have Invoke the Sun God) and your new level is even, choose a new invocation"). That
 * level is stamped when the move is taken (StonetopCharacter#_applyForeignMoveChoice); a taker with
 * no stamp (one who took it before the stamp existed) gets no cue rather than a wrong one.
 *
 * Never more than the list holds: there are ten, and a 20th-level Lightbearer cannot owe an eleventh.
 *
 * Pure: no Foundry global.
