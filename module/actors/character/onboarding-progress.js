// ── Where a player has got to in character creation ────────────────────────────
// The creation flow stamps its position on the character as
// flags.stonetop_pwd.onboardingProgress (see StonetopCharacterSheet#_setOnboardingState),
// which is the only part of a player's local, uncommitted progress the GM can read.
//
// Two surfaces read it, and they must agree: the Welcome guide's player roster ("on page
// 4 of 9"), and the confirmation shown before a replacement mint deletes that character —
// where "they are halfway through creation" is the fact that should stop the GM's hand.

 * With no flag, a character with no playbook yet hasn't been touched; one that has a
 * playbook is finished.

 * `finished` is the CREATION_FINISHED_FLAG. A playbook WITH it is finished whatever the
 * progress flag says. A playbook without it is finished only when no progress flag is live:
 * that is every character made before the flag existed, and must not suddenly read as half
 * built. A playbook without it and with a live progress flag is a "Save & close" part-way
