// "7-9: the steading must consume 1d4+Population more Surplus before winter ends, or suffer
//  the consequences again.  6-: as 7-9, plus threats abound."
//
// EVERY other seasonal obligation is derivable: the watch's upkeep is "built, and not stamped
// for this season", and the tray works it out from state that was already there. This one is
// not. It is created by a die roll, its amount is another die roll, and until now nothing in
// the system remembered either — the 7-9 was said once in a chat card and the table carried it
// in their heads across however many sessions winter took.
//
// So this is the one hold with storage of its own (StonetopSteading#winterDebt), and the one
// with a settle control of its own. The others are all closed out inside the Seasons Change
// window; this one comes due AFTER that window is shut, which is exactly why the header glyph
// is the right place for it and why the glyph has to lead somewhere.
//
// THE DEADLINE IS THE STAMP. The debt is recorded against the "<year>:<season>" it was rolled
// in, so the header glyph goes out by the debt ceasing to match the clock, the way Tor's
// blessing does. But the rule does not let it lapse: "before winter ends, OR suffer the
// consequences". So the next spring's Seasons Change opens on it ("Winter's end"), found by
// its stamp rather than by the clock, and asks the same two-way question this file's window
// asks. It is asked in the open, in the window the GM is already walking, never charged
// quietly behind the table's back.
