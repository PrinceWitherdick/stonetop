/**
 * IMPROVEMENTS AT THE MOMENT OF A ROLL: what the steading has built, turned into the questions a
 * homefront move's window asks and the changes the answers make to the dice.
 *
 * Most of what an improvement does "henceforth" happens when the Seasons Change, and the season
 * window already handles it. These are the rest: the ones that change a MOVE. Some always apply
 * (a Township has advantage to Muster, Pull Together and Trade & Barter). Most turn on something
 * only the table knows ("when you take advantage of the stone wall", "when you specifically
 * involve the watch"), so the window asks, and asks only once the improvement is built.
 *
 * Pure: the sheet hands in the steading's RULES LIST (improvement-rules.js, the improvements in
 * force with their grants) and the militia's trained tactics, so every rule here can be tested as
 * a rule.
 *
 * Advantage is a GRANT now, not a slug: `rollAdvantage: {moves, ask?}` on the improvement (the
 * Township's three moves always; the Palisade's and the Stone Wall's Deploy when "you take
 * advantage of" the wall; Book II's Barrier Pass and Aetherium Crucible on Trade & Barter for named
 * goods). Always-on when it has no `ask`; asked, as an unticked box carrying the `ask` text, when it
 * does. What stays keyed by slug here is what no grant can say: the militia's tactic, the watch's
 * +1 Defenses, the herd's half-cost and its Requisition count.
