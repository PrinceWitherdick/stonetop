/**
 * The "pick one debility, then commit from the footer" window.
 *
 * ONE implementation, because every move that clears a debility puts the same question the
 * same way, and the details that make it work are the easiest thing to lose in a copy:
 *
 * · Picking and committing are separate acts. A click used to write the clear and shut the
 *   window in one motion, which put an irreversible steading edit a single mis-click away and
 *   left no moment to read the row before it landed. A click now only marks the choice; the
 *   footer button writes it, and it NAMES the debility it is about to clear so there is no
 *   doubt what the press does. Nothing starts picked, so the button starts disabled.
 *
 * · `autofocus` on the first row is load-bearing, not polish: Foundry's own Tab handler pulls
 *   focus to the first `.dialog-button` whenever focus is outside the dialog, and a DISABLED
 *   button cannot take focus — so without a focus target inside the window, Tab would never
 *   get a keyboard user in. Starting focus on a row leaves Tab to the browser from then on.
 *
 * · Arming the button GROWS it, and the window has to be told. A `Dialog` carries no
 *   `height: "auto"`, so core pins `style.height` to whatever the content measured on the very
 *   first render — before anything is picked and while the button still reads "Clear Debility".
 *   The armed label names its debility and takes a second line (see the footer-button rule in
 *   stonetop.css), and that extra line was landing outside the window and being clipped. So
 *   each relabel re-measures the frame's natural height and grows to it. GROWS only: a window
 *   the table has dragged taller keeps its height, and shrinking back on the next pick would
 *   make the frame twitch under the cursor.
 *
 * · The apply callback is guarded rather than trusted to be unreachable: Foundry submits the
 *   `default` button on Enter whenever focus sits anywhere in the window, and `disabled` only
 *   stops the click. With nothing picked it closes writing nothing, like Escape.
 *
 * · `html[0] ?? html` both times: core hands render callbacks jQuery on v13 and there is no
 *   promise it always will. A bare `html[0]` would throw one line after the button was
 *   disabled and before a single row listener was wired, leaving a window whose only button
 *   is dead and whose rows do nothing — so the move could not be made at all.
 *
 * @param {object} opts
 * @param {string} opts.title             window title
