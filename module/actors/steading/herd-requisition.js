/**
 * Requisitioning from the Herd of Horses: how many horses go?
 *
 * The herd's row on the Assets list is not one asset to lend out whole. It stands for a dozen
 * horses or more, and the Herd's own rule turns on how many are taken ("When you Requisition half
 * the herd or less, treat a 6- as a 7-9"). So the table is asked (the user's ruling, 2026-10-03),
 * defaulting to 2, the pair of draft horses the herd replaced on the list, or to the count the
 * Requisition roll was made for when the window asked it first; never more than the herd's GROWN
 * horses (a yearling is untrained and a foal a foal). What is taken comes out of the tracked herd
 * (StonetopSteading#requisitionFromHerd), and goes back on its card by hand when it comes home.
 *
 * Used by both doors that take an asset: a character's Requisition window and the expedition
 * walkthrough's asset picker.
 *
 * @param {object} o
 * @param {number} o.cap       the herd's grown horses (StonetopSteading#herdRequisitionCap)
 * @param {number} [o.preset]  the count already asked for the roll, if any
 * @param {string} [o.who]     who is taking them, for the question
 * @returns {Promise<number>} how many to take; 0 for none (closed, declined, or no horses to take)
