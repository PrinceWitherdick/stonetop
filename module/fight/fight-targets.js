// Who a roll hits when nobody picked a target by hand: whoever the roller is fighting.
//
// The Fight tab already knows that (engagements.js): tokens touching are in melee, and a player's target
// is a shot. So a character's Clash lands on the foe they are standing against, and a monster's damage
// lands on the character standing against it, without anyone reaching for T.
//
// HAND TARGETS STILL WIN. A player who targeted something meant it, and the GM's own targets are the
// only way to aim a monster at somebody it is not touching.
//
// A HERO hits the foes they are in melee with, then any they are shooting at. A FOE hits the heroes in
// melee with it, and only when there are none, the heroes it has a shot on record at (fight-shots.js),
// then the heroes shooting at it: a monster with a character in its face is not swinging at the archer
// behind them.
//
// SEVERAL IS A QUESTION, NOT A DEFAULT. Clash and Let Fly are written against one foe. Book I p.414 (and
// Clash's own notes, p.215): "When a PC or follower's attack could feasibly hurt multiple foes—because of
// the area tag, because a group of followers is making or Aiding the attack, or just because the player
// describes it in a way that makes sense—then the player rolls to Clash or Let Fly just once, but they
// roll damage separately against each foe." Only the roller knows which of those this is, so a roller
// fighting more than one is asked, with the first ticked.
