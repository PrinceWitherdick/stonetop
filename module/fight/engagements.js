// Who is fighting whom, worked out from where the tokens stand.
//
// Book I p.414: "When the PCs face multiple foes (and they often will), break up the action into
// multiple smaller engagements... This isn't anything formal." So nothing here is a record anybody
// keeps. A player shows who they are fighting by moving their token up against it, or by targeting
// it from range, and every client works the same answer out of the same token positions: nobody
// writes anything when a token moves, and nothing can fall out of step with the map.
//
// PURE. Fighters arrive as plain data (fight-state.js builds them from documents), which is what
// lets this be tested without a canvas and lets the Fight tab, the map overlay and the damage
// pre-fill all ask one function the same question.
//
// WHAT COUNTS:
//  • Two fighters on OPPOSITE sides whose tokens touch (diagonals included) are in melee.
//  • A ranged link is a shot: a player's target (their fighter shooting at a fighter on the other
//    side), or a shot on record from the last damage a fighter rolled at range (fight-shots.js).
//    Melee wins when both hold, since standing in contact is the stronger claim, and a shot on
//    record lapses while its shooter is in melee with anybody: they are fighting hand to hand now.
//  • EVERYONE HITTING A FIGHTER IS ATTACKING IT, near or far, whichever side it is on: an archer
//    shooting a character is one more on them, as a character's arrow is one more on a foe.
//  • NO MORE CAN CLOSE WITH ONE FIGHTER THAN FIT ROUND IT. A horde token of twelve touching a lone
//    hero counts only as many as there are squares around the hero (8 round a man-sized token).
//    "Holding a chokepoint reduces the number of foes they have to fight at once" (p.414) is still
//    the table's to say: the seed that carries the count is theirs to leave off.
//  • A fighter who is out (defeated, 0 HP, a routed group) or has no bodies left is not a "capable
//    attacker" (p.414) and is never linked or counted.
//  • A fighter this client may not see is not there at all, so a hidden foe never changes what a
//    player's screen says.
//  • BODIES, not tokens: a horde token fighting as a group stands for the members still standing,
//    and a crew token for its headcount (fight-sides.js#bodiesFor). Two crinwin on one token count
//    as two attackers, exactly as two tokens would.
