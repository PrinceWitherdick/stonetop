// The Fight window: the Fight tab popped out into a window of its own, opened when a fight starts on
// the map this reader is looking at and closed again when it ends.
//
// WHY A WINDOW. At the table the sidebar sits on Chat, where the rolls land, so a tab is somewhere
// nobody is looking while a fight is on. The tracker-dock modules solve that for Foundry's own tracker
// by showing it when a combat starts; this does the same for the Fight tab.
//
// IT IS CORE'S POP-OUT, not a window of our own. `renderPopout` makes a second FightTracker inside a
// frame, and core hands every redraw of the tab to it as well, so every button, the context menu,
// hovering a row to light its token and clicking one to pan there all work in the window with no code
// of ours. FightTracker.js gives the pop-out its place, its size and a resize handle.
//
// WHEN IT OPENS AND CLOSES, per client (`fightWindowStep` decides, and is pure):
//  • ONCE PER FIGHT: when the fight starts on this reader's map, when they arrive on its map, when they
//    reload in the middle of it. A redraw of the same fight never reopens a window they closed.
//  • A PLAYER WAITS UNTIL THEY CAN SEE SOMEONE IN IT. A GM setting up an ambush out of hidden tokens
//    must not announce it with a window on every player's screen.
//  • CLOSED BY THE READER, IT STAYS CLOSED FOR THAT FIGHT, across a reload too. The next fight opens
//    it, and the tab's "Open in a window" brings it back sooner.
//  • IT CLOSES WHEN THIS MAP HAS NO FIGHT ON IT ANY MORE (the fight ended, or the reader went to
//    another map), however it was opened: a window saying "No fight on this scene" is clutter.
//  • `fightWindowAuto`, a client setting, stops the opening. The closing stays.
//  • A FIGHT NO WINDOW WILL SHOW GOES TO THE SIDEBAR instead (`showFightInSidebar`): the tab comes up
//    on the Fight tab, as Start a fight already does. However a fight is started — the Start window, a
//    macro, or tokens toggled into combat from their HUD — it lands in front of the table somewhere.
//
// WITH THE FIGHT TAB OFF, the same window opens over core's own Combat tracker (`installCombatWindow`,
// at the foot of this file). A table running an initiative module wants the tracker in front of them
// when a fight starts just as much, and this is the one piece of the Fight tab that says nothing about
// how Stonetop fights: it opens a window core already knows how to draw. Everything else stays off.
// What differs there:
//  • ANY COMBAT COUNTS, not only one stamped as a fight: with the tab off nothing of ours stamps them.
//    A Combat with nobody in it yet does not, so pressing Create Encounter opens no window.
//  • THE PLACE AND THE CLOSING COME FROM HOOKS, not from FightTracker: core's tracker is core's class,
//    so the saved place is set on the pop-out once it has drawn, and `closeCombatTracker` is where the
//    reader closing it is heard.
