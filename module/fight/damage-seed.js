// The fight's extra damage, offered to a damage roll before it is rolled.
//
// Book I p.414: "When multiple combatants deal damage to a single foe, roll one combatant's damage
// (usually the best one) and add +1 extra damage for each capable attacker after the first." The fight
// already knows who is attacking whom (engagements.js), so a damage roll against a foe several people
// are fighting opens with that +N filled in and named, and a counter-attack from several foes on one
// character carries it too.
//
// A SEED, NOT A RULING. It is ticked and labelled in the damage window, where the roller can untick it,
// and it is named on the damage card, where whoever presses Apply can leave it off. The book's own
// example waives it ("Didn't I cut the first one down before it could hurt me?" "Good point.", p.415),
// and a table that agrees with that needs one click, not a hand-edited HP box.
//
// ONLY FOR A SINGLE FOE, as the sentence says: a token standing for a crew or a horde is several foes,
// and fighting it is the group rules' business. And only with the Fight tab on: with it off there is
// no fight record to read, and nothing here builds a seed.
//
// GROUP AGAINST GROUP (p.416) gets a seed of its own, on a group token's damage rolled from its sheet
// (a monster fighting as a group, or a crew with a headcount): "If one group outnumbers the other, they
// get a +1 bonus to damage and armor for every multiplier past 1." The bigger group's roll opens with
// +N damage; the smaller group's opens with -N, which is the bigger group's +N armor taken off the roll,
// since a stat block's damage card has nothing that applies armor. Both are counted over the groups in
// the engagement only: "Foes that are engaged by individual PCs aren't really part of a group."
//
// A MONSTER GROUP WITH NO GROUP TO FIGHT piles on like anyone else, with every body it stands for: a
// horde of six on a lone hero is six attackers and +5 (p.414 counts attackers, not tokens), which is
// what the tab's badge and that hero's own counter-blow already say. With the Fight tab on, its stat
// block draws no swarm row (StonetopMonsterSheet), so this is where that number comes from. Any other
// group keeps to the group seed: a follower group's own Swarm die (fight/follower-fight.js) carries its
// pile-on, beside a plain die that is one member's, and a seed on either would count the crew twice or
// undo that split.
//
// THE OTHER ATTACKERS' DICE AND TAGS RIDE ALONG. The book rolls "one combatant's damage (usually the best
// one)" and applies "tags from all the attackers as they make sense" (p.414; p.239 "roll the single highest
// damage die among them... The tags from all the combatants apply"). So a pile-on seed carries every other
// attacker's die (`dice`), which the damage window turns into an offer to roll the best of them in place
// of the roller's own (utils/damage.js#settleBestDie), and their tags and piercing, which the damage card
// adds to the blow's own (combat/attack-flow.js#withSeedTags). A character's die is read off their sheet;
// the tags of whatever weapon they would swing are theirs to say, so only a stat block's are carried.
//
// SEPARATE ROLLS ARE NOT ONE ATTACK. "When multiple PCs and/or followers attack a foe at once, one of them
// rolls Clash or Let Fly and the others Aid" (p.414): the +N is for attacking together. Two characters in
// contact with one foe usually take their swings in turn, each rolling their own damage, and a +1 ticked on
// both is the same extra body counted twice. So when another CHARACTER is among the attackers the seed
// opens unticked, worded as an offer, and the roller ticks it when they are striking together. Followers and
// monsters do not roll their own damage beside the roller's, so a seed made of them opens ticked.
//
// The seed is plain data, carried through the damage window, the roll and the card's flags:
//   { bonus, count, direction: "onFoe"|"onHero", target, names, label, pill, pillLeftOff, cite, applied,
//     dice, tags, piercing, best?, useBest? }
