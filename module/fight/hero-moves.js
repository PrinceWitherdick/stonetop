// Playbook moves that change a blow in a fight, read off the fight on the map.
//
// Most of what a character's moves do in a fight is fiction, and stays the table's. These change a number
// the damage card is about to write, or a die a foe is about to roll, and the fight already knows the
// facts they turn on:
//  • UNDAUNTED (Would-Be Hero): "When you are outnumbered or facing a foe bigger than you, you get +1 armor
//    and deal +1d6 damage." Outnumbered is the fight's count: more than one on them, or more foes than
//    heroes in their engagement. Bigger is the stat block's size, large or huge. Where the fight does
//    not show it (no fight on the map, the Fight tab off, "bigger than you" no size on the stat block),
//    both halves are offered UNTICKED for the table to call (the user's ruling, 2026-09-27).
//  • BIG DAMN HERO (Would-Be Hero): "When you Defend, you can spend 1 Readiness to lock eyes with an
//    attacker; they have disadvantage on damage rolls against you and your ward for the rest of the fight."
//    Kept on the hero's combatant, so it ends with the fight. The ward is whoever stands beside the hero:
//    the fight has no record of who a character is protecting, and a Defend is made for the people right
//    there. Its first half, "When you first leap into danger to protect someone, don't roll to Defend.
//    Instead, treat it as though you rolled a 10+", is `leapIn`: once per fight, kept on the combatant
//    beside the locked eyes.
//  • TOUGH LOVE (Would-Be Hero): "When you honestly think another PC is in the wrong and call them on it,
//    they have disadvantage on any rolls against you until you two work it out." The hero names the PC
//    (`callOut`) and clears it by hand (`workedItOut`); that PC's rolls aimed at the hero read it
//    (`toughLoveAgainst`), the other side of Binding Arbitration's oathbreaker.
//  • DANGEROUS (Heavy): "When you deal your damage, you have advantage." Every roll of the character's own
//    damage, in a fight or not; it meets a strike back's disadvantage and the two cancel.
//  • MUSCLEBOUND (Heavy): "When you make a hand-to-hand or thrown attack, it's forceful and messy."
//  • SOMETHING TO REMEMBER ME BY (Would-Be Hero): "+1d4" on a strike back bought with Readiness.
//  • SECOND INTENT (Fox): a Parry & Riposte also picks 1 from the Ambush list, and "Deal +1d4 damage" is
//    one of them. Offered UNTICKED on the parry's strike back, since the pick may be another option.
//  • HUNGRY FLAMES (Lightbearer): "+1d6" whenever the blow is dealt with a holy light.
//  • BIG GAME HUNTER / GIANT SLAYER (Ranger): "+2" / "another +2" at the weak spot of a large or huge
//    creature. The fight knows the size; whether this blow found the weak spot is the table's, so the
//    window opens with the box UNTICKED.
//  • NEMESIS / RELENTLESS (Heavy): both turn on "when you Clash and your foe survives", so both read the
//    same record of the foes this character has Clashed (`clashedWith`). A foe that did NOT survive never
//    comes up again, which is why the record is written at the Clash rather than waiting on the corpse.
//  • PAYBACK (Heavy): "+1d4" against a foe that has harmed this character or an ally. Apply writes who hurt
//    whom on the HARMED character (`harmedBy`), because Apply often runs on a player's client, which cannot
//    write the Combat document. A follower is an ally too (the user's ruling): a blow on one is written on
//    the character it follows.
//  • BLOOD-SOAKED PAST (Heavy background): "When you fight to kill without mercy or hesitation, you deal
//    +1d4 damage." Pure fiction, so a standing UNTICKED line, like Predator's.
//  • NEVER GONNA KEEP ME DOWN (Would-Be Hero) at 5 HP or less, UNCANNY REFLEXES (Heavy) unarmored under a
//    light or normal load, and BATTLEFIELD GRACE (Marshal) leading allies: each puts the damage THEY take
//    at disadvantage, like locked eyes from the other side.
// The Defend spends on the damage card (Parry & Riposte, Steadfast Guardian, A Mighty Rampart) are in
// defend-spend.js.
