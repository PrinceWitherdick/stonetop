// The order Character Introductions go around the table in, held by the introductions themselves.
//
// WHY NOT THE COMBAT TRACKER, which is where this order lived until the Fight tab replaced it. The
// dialog used to create a Combat, drop every player character into it and read the order back as
// initiative, so "set the order" meant rolling or typing initiative in a tracker that has nothing to
// do with introductions. Two things went wrong with that the moment fights got a tab of their own:
//  • THE TRACKER NO LONGER HAS INITIATIVE. Stonetop has no turn order in a fight (Book I p.417), so
//    the tab that replaces it shows engagements instead, and there is nowhere left to type a number.
//  • OPENING INTRODUCTIONS JOINED A FIGHT. It added every PC to whatever `game.combat` happened to be,
//    so a table that opened the window with a fight running on the scene put the whole party into
//    that fight, tokenless.
//
// So the order is a world setting of its own: a list of actor ids, written only by a GM, read by
// everyone. A world that had already arranged its table in the tracker keeps that order: the first
// time a GM opens the window, the old turn order is copied across once (`adoptLegacyIntroOrder`),
// and from then on the setting is the only thing read.
//
// The arithmetic is pure and unit-tested; only the last four functions touch Foundry.
