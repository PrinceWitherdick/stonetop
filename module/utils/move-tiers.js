 * move already carries those same outcomes as STRUCTURED data in `system.moveResults`, so this
 * module lifts them out of the paragraph and re-lays them as the labelled ladder the love
 * letter reader and the Death's Door dialog already use (.stonetop-love-letter-read-tiers,
 * .deaths-door-outcome).
 *
 * Done at RENDER time rather than in the pack source on purpose: a move already copied onto a
 * character in a live world carries its own description, and so does any homebrew move, so a
 * pack edit would fix neither. Nothing here mutates a document.
 *
 * It also fills a hole. A handful of moves (the Blessed's Borrow Power, Suck the Poison Out)
 * and EVERY player-authored custom move keep their outcomes only in `moveResults` and leave
 * them out of the description — so until now their results were invisible on the sheet and
 * only ever appeared on a roll card.
