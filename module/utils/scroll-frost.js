// tab's first row even when nothing has scrolled anywhere, which reads as a rendering fault
// rather than a depth cue. So the class goes on only while the active tab is off its top.
//
// Why JS at all: the band cannot live inside the scrollport (each tab is its own, and the
// band would scroll away with the content), so it sits on `.sheet-body` — outside every
// scroller — and CSS has no way to ask "is my descendant scrolled". A scroll-driven
// animation (`animation-timeline: scroll()`) resolves against the animated element's own
// scrolling ancestor, which for the band is the window, not the tab.
