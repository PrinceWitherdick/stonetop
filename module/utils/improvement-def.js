// The shape of a steading improvement, and the normalizers that keep every way of
// authoring one honest. Three paths produce a definition and they must all agree:
//
//   - the builder dialog (ImprovementBuilderDialog), typing one from scratch;
//   - a homebrew journal card, dropped onto a steading (steading-improvement-cards.js);
//   - the book's own IMPROVEMENT_DEFINITIONS in StonetopSteading.js.
//
// A definition is `{ name, category, flavor, sections[], effect, grants }`. The parts
// that used to be lost on the authored paths, and are the reason this file exists:
//
//   sections[].min    how many of the section's items must be ticked (absent = all of
//                     them), so "Requires 2 of the following" is authorable;
//   sections[].group  sections sharing a group id are ALTERNATIVES (OR) rather than
//                     each standing on their own (AND): Weapons of War's "either this,
//                     or all of these";
//   grants            the one-time mechanical effects applied when it is completed, the
//                     custom-improvement twin of IMPROVEMENT_GRANTS.
//
// The first two are already understood by improvementRequirementsMet and the third by
// setImprovementCompleted; what was missing was any way to author them, and anywhere
// for them to survive between the form and the steading.
//
// A heading, a requirement item and the effect prose are stored as HTML, because that is
// what the book's own definitions already are ("<em>Pull Together</em>") and what both
// readers paint unescaped. Authored text therefore passes through formatImprovementText
// on its way in: escaped once, then the single piece of markup the playbook actually
// uses, *asterisks* around a move name, resolved to <em>. unformatImprovementText is the
// way back out, for re-opening an improvement that already exists in the builder.
