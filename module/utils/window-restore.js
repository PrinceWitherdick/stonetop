// Reopen document sheets (characters, steadings, monsters, items, journals) in the

// doesn't restore open windows across a refresh, so we keep a live registry of the open
// document sheets, persist a snapshot (geometry, active tab, edit/lock mode) to a
// per-client setting, and re-render each one on ready from that snapshot.
//
// Scope is deliberately narrow: only windows over a document (things resolvable by uuid
// and re-openable via `doc.sheet`), plus the few windows over something else that register
// a kind of their own (registerRestorableWindow, below). Transient dialogs — the level-up
// wizard, the introductions walkthrough, pickers — are NOT tracked here: reopening a
// half-finished wizard is worse than not, and the session-zero walkthroughs already have
// their own reload-resume path (dialogs/walkthrough-resume.js).
//
// Per-client on purpose: window layout is personal, not shared world state (mirrors the
// existing `characterSheetWidths` client setting). Defaults on; the "Restore Open
// Windows on Reload" client setting turns it off.
//
// ⚠ AND NESTED UNDER THE WORLD ID, which a client setting has to do for itself (relmap/relmap-last.js
// says why): it lives in localStorage under `namespace.key` alone, shared by every world this browser
// opens, and every save writes the whole record. Kept flat, a GM who left sheets open in one world and
// spent an evening in another came back to nothing, because the second world's first save wrote its
// own list over the first world's -- and a world copied from another, with the same document ids,
// reopened the other world's windows. The snapshot for each window is unchanged; only the record
// holding them is keyed by world.
