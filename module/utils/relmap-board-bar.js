// What the two bars that float over a relationship map have in common: the line's
// (utils/relmap-tie-bar.js) and the group's (utils/relmap-group-bar.js).
//
// WRITTEN ONCE BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN WRITTEN TWICE. The group bar was built as the tie bar's smaller
// sibling and came out carrying a copy of its machinery: the listeners it has to take back off, the
// sentence held back a breath before it is written, the arithmetic that floats it over one point of
// a board that pans, the keys it claims from core and the arrow-key walk along a row of presses. Two
// copies of that are two places for the next fix to land in only one of -- and a bar that leaks
// Delete to the scene, or loses a half-typed name to a repaint, is not a fault a table would ever
// trace back to which of the two bars it happened on.
//
// ⚠ ONLY WHAT THE TWO DO THE SAME IS HERE. Where they differ they differ on purpose, and that stays
// with the bar it belongs to: the eight seats the tie bar tries so as to keep off its own stroke, its
// panels and the colours held back beside the caption, what Escape and Enter each mean, and which
// keys each lets through.
//
// THE HOUSE RULES BOTH KEEP, said at length in the tie bar and once more here:
//
//  • THEY LIVE IN THE VIEWPORT AND NOT ON THE BOARD. The board's markup is replaced on every live
//    update, and a bar drawn on it would go with it, half-typed words and the focus included. Out
//    here a bar survives every repaint and is only re-placed; nothing moves it except `place`.
//  • THEY ARE PLACED IN SCREEN PIXELS, NOT BOARD PERCENTAGES. A bar riding the board's transform
//    would shrink to nothing at the zoom a forty-person map is read at.
//  • THEY WRITE ONTO MARKUP A RENDER LEFT STANDING (`hidden`, never behind an `{{#if}}`), and carry
//    no i18n: every word they show arrives on the markup.
//  • WHAT IS TYPED IS HELD BACK BEFORE IT IS WRITTEN, so a sentence typed out is one broadcast and one
//    step of the undo rather than one per letter. `isWriting` is what the window's repaint asks
//    before it paints over a field.
//  • KEYS ARE CLAIMED ON THE BAR AND STOPPED, because core's KeyboardManager listens in the bubble
//    phase and never looks at `defaultPrevented`.

 * Mark exactly one of a group as chosen -- in the class, in the ARIA, and in the TAB ORDER.
 *
 * ⚠ THE TAB ORDER IS THE THIRD OF THOSE AND IS NOT DECORATION. These are `role="radio"` buttons in
 * a `role="radiogroup"`, and a radio group is ONE tab stop with the arrow keys inside it. Left as
 * ordinary buttons, a bar would put a stop at every one of them between the board and whatever
 * comes after it -- on a floating strip a reader arrives at by clicking the board, which is the worst
 * place in the window to lose somebody. So exactly one button per group is reachable by Tab (the
 * one that is set), and `RelmapBoardBar#_rove` moves the focus between the rest.
 *
 * ⚠ AND A HIDDEN BUTTON IS NOT IN THE GROUP AT ALL. The tie bar's palette carries a fixed set of
 * slots for the colours already on the board and shows only as many as there are -- a `hidden` slot
 * given the tab stop is a group with no reachable button in it, which is a radiogroup a keyboard
 * cannot enter.
 *
 * ⚠ `may` IS FOR THE ONE GROUP WHOSE ANSWER HONESTLY MIGHT NOT BE ON THE LIST. Everywhere else, a
 * value that matches no button is a template that has drifted from the store, and the first button
 * taking the mark is a defence against a group nobody can reach. The sizes are different in kind: a
 * reader may type any number in the bounds, and 22 is a perfectly good answer that no step stands
 * for -- so the first step must NOT come up looking pressed, which would say the line is set in ten
 * when it is set in twenty-two. Passed `false`, nothing shows as chosen and the tab stop goes to the
 * first button anyway, because the group still has to be reachable.
 *
 * `key` is the dataset field a button's value is read from, which is how both bars share this.
