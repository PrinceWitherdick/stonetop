/**
 * Add a control to an ImagePopout's window header, across AppV1 and AppV2.
 *
 * Core builds the header after the popout renders and can rebuild it, so injection is retried on
 * a rAF and two timeouts rather than done once. Each pass is idempotent.
 *
 * ⚠ THE GUARD IS PER KEY, NOT PER WINDOW. It used to be "does this header already have a control
 * at all", which silently caps a header at one: the first successful pass installs the first
 * button and every later pass bails before reaching the second. Two controls on one popout is
 * exactly what the portrait framer needs (Edit Photo beside Frame Face), so the guard has to ask
 * about the control being added, not about the header.

/**
 * The "Frame …" control, for the three popouts that offer it: a PC's portrait, a monster's

 *
 * One helper rather than three copies of the same key/icon/label/title quartet, because they only
 * work if they agree — the key is the dedupe guard, and the label is a shared i18n string. The
 * three differed already: two titled the editor from `actor.name` and the third from the popout's
 * own title, with nothing to say whether that was deliberate. It is: a legacy roster row has no
 * document to take a name from, which is why `name` is passed in rather than read off the handle.

 * returned without gating first.
