// ── One writer for a roll card's dice ───────────────────────────────────────
// A posted roll card's dice are rewritten from half a dozen places: the GM's Shift Up/Down, a Judge's or a
// Lightbearer's +1 (actors/character/roll-boosts.js), Burn Brightly, Impetuous Youth's "give it your all", a
// Seeker's Logbook or Books & Scrolls, and We Happy Few's Inspiration die on a damage card. Each reads the
// card's `rolls` and `flavor`, lifts the total, and writes both back WHOLE. Two clients doing that at once
// each write from their own copy, and whichever lands second erases the other's +1.
//
// So every rewrite keeps two rules, both kept here:
//
//  1. ONE CLIENT PER CARD (rollCardRoute). While a GM is connected, the primary GM's client writes every
//     player's rewrite of every card: each press is relayed there, to this file's ROLL_CARD_QUERY or to the
//     relay its own module already had (roll-boosts.js BOOST_QUERY, inspiration-flow.js INSPIRATION_QUERY,
//     deaths-door-relay.js DEATHS_DOOR_BOOST_QUERY). With no GM connected, only a card's author can write it
//     (a chat message is "the GM, or whoever authored it"), so that client is the one writer anyway. A GM's
//     own press is written on their own client: v13 names no asker for a GM's query (foundry-compat.js
//     #queryAsker), so a second GM could not be relayed, and two GMs pressing the same card at once is the
//     one race left.
//
//  2. ONE AT A TIME ON THAT CLIENT (writeCardRoll, called in the card's turn, utils/card-queue.js). The roll
//     is read when the turn comes, lifted on a COPY, and written with its redrawn flavor in one update, so a
//     write that is refused leaves the card's own roll as it was for the next press.
