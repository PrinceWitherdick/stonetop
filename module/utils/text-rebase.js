// ── Two people typing into one text field (pure core) ──────────────────────────
// A shared field stored as one whole string (a flag, a setting) is last-writer-wins: every
// write replaces the lot, so whoever saves second rubs out whatever the first had typed that
// the second had not yet seen. These helpers let a client take a newer value written by
// somebody else WITHOUT losing what it has typed since it last saw the field: a three-way
// merge of the two against the value both started from, the way version control merges two
// branches.
//
// Edits in different places are all kept. Where both sides changed the same words there is no
// right answer, and the text typed HERE wins: the person at this keyboard never watches their
// own words vanish, and their next save hands the result on. Where both sides hold the SAME
// addition (which happens when a save that already carried the other's words crosses one that
// didn't), it is kept once, not twice.

// Past this many edits the two texts are treated as simply different: one edit replacing
// everything between their common start and end. Keeps a paste over the whole field from
// costing a quadratic diff.
